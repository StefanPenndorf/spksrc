DESCRIPTION = Minetest is an infinite-world block sandbox game and game engine. Players can create and destroy various types of blocks in a three-dimensional open world. This allows forming structures in every possible creation, on multiplayer servers or in singleplayer. Minetest is designed to be simple, stable, and portable. It is lightweight enough to run on fairly old hardware.
