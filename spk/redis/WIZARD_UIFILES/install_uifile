        "desc": "Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. Redis is written in ANSI C and works in most POSIX systems like Linux, *BSD, and OS X, without external dependencies. Linux and OS X are the two operating systems where Redis is developed and tested the most, and we recommend using Linux for deployment. Redis may work in Solaris-derived systems like SmartOS, but the support is best effort. There is no official support for Windows builds."
